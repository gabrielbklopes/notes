    What is a port? Each port has 16 pins where you can connect external peripherals

    To control pin use GPIO D Peripheral -> It also has set of registers which are used to control pin's mode.
    You can access this registers using memory address.

    What are processor addresseble memory location?

    How to enable the peripheral clock?
    - Use the peripheral clock control registers 
    - 0x4002 3800 + 0x30 and set 3 bit position (GPIODEN)
        - 0x40023830
    - for pin 12 looking at fields 24 and 25
        - 0x40020C00 + 0x00 ==> 0x40020C00
    - 0x40020C00 + 0x14 ==> 0x40020C14

*   Bitwise Operators 

    Right shift operator (>>)
    ex.:
    char a = 111;
    char b = a >> 4;
    writing in binary a = 01101111
    a >> 1 = 00110111
    a >> 2 = 00011011
    a >> 3 = 00001101
    a >> 4 = 00000110 so 
    b = 00000110 (0x06)

    Left shift operator (<<0)
    ex.: same values as before
    a << 1 = 11011110
    a << 2 = 10111100
    a << 3 = 01111000
    a << 4 = 11110000 
    b = 11110000 (0xF0 or 240)

    Use the shift operator to set the 4th bit
    -> shift the number by the number you want to set so 1 << 4
    In that way you can find the mask value, then
    if Data = 0x08
    Data = Data | (1<<4) = 0x18;

    Use the shift operator to clear the 4th bit
    -> Use same structure as before and then negate the mask
    if Data = 0x18;
    Data = Data & ~(1 << 4) = 0x08;
